  Characteristics
  It has a tan exterior similar to Palm Wood and a light grey interior. They often grow tall and skinny with large, green, cubic leaves. Although it is fairly common, it still sells for more than Oak Wood, with a log selling for $2.25 Money per unit, and a plank selling for $15 Money per unit. Birch Wood can also commonly be mistaken for Gray Wood because of its gray-ish white look.
  
  Harvesting
  Birch wood can most easily be harvested from the Mountainside, although it is also possible to travel to the Tropics to obtain this wood. This method, however, is very costly and inefficient as you must take the Ferry. A Hardened Axe or better is recommended for harvesting.
  
  A Fair Sawmill or better is highly recommended for milling purposes, as these sawmills can handle its size and thickness on all occasions. A vehicle is also recommended since the areas where it grows at, are a considerable distance from the Main Biome.
